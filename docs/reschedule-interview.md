Hello [contact name],

I sincerely apologize, but I’d like to request a reschedule of our interview. We were originally scheduled to meet [date] at [time] to discuss the [the job title] position. However, a family member just had an accident, and I need to assist with his care this week [or insert your rescheduling reason here]. If it would be at all possible, I’d appreciate being able to reschedule our interview for sometime next week. I’d be available [your availability--be as flexible as possible, and be sure to include your time zone].

Again, I apologize--I was greatly looking forward to our interview on [day], and I hope that we’ll be able to reschedule.

Have a great day,

[Your name]
