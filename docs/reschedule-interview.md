### One day before Interview

```
Hello [contact name],

I sincerely apologize, but I’d like to request a reschedule of our interview. We were originally scheduled to meet [date] at [time] to discuss the [the job title] position. However, a family member just had an accident, and I need to assist with his care this week [or insert your rescheduling reason here]. If it would be at all possible, I’d appreciate being able to reschedule our interview for sometime next week. I’d be available [your availability--be as flexible as possible, and be sure to include your time zone].

Again, I apologize--I was greatly looking forward to our interview on [day], and I hope that we’ll be able to reschedule.

Have a great day,

[Your name]

### If Internet goes down

```
Hello [interviewer name],

I’m incredibly sorry for dropping out of our video call--my ISP just reported that internet is down across the whole town [or whatever caused the internet issue], and the issue likely won’t be fixed within the hour. I’m mortified that this happened in the middle of our interview and if at all possible, I would deeply appreciate the ability to reschedule. I know that rescheduling may not be possible within your hiring timeline, but I’m very excited about this opportunity and would love a chance to show the value I’d bring to your team. 

Sincerely,

[your name]
